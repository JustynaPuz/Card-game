# Daschund card game
## Overview
The Card Game is a strategic simulation where players manage a kingdom by making decisions through a deck of thematic cards. Each card presents a scenario affecting the kingdom's core attributes: food, military, economy, and religion. The unique twist of the game is its dachshund theme, where all cards are inspired by dachshunds, adding a playful element to the serious task of kingdom management.

## Gameplay
Players interact with the game by either accepting or rejecting cards that appear on the screen. Each decision will either positively or negatively impact the kingdom's attributes. The goal is to maintain balance in the kingdom, ensuring none of the attributes fall to zero or below, which would result in the end of the game.
